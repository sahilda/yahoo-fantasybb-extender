The extension can be found here: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yahoo-fantasy-basketball/dajecldpmkjkhofjdmblkcgplmapkiee].

## TODOs
* Change the display from total games this week to games left this week (will require a better set).
* In the [players list page](https://basketball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/nba/161459/players), the games left stat does not load when a user hits the 'Next 25' button on the bottom.

## Credits
* Weekly game schedule was found here: [https://basketballmonster.com/ScheduleGrid.aspx].
* Basketball icon found here: [https://icons8.com/icon/12969/basketball].
